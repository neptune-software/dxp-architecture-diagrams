## Introduction

Welcome to the **Neptune Draw.io Architecture Diagrams** repository!

This repository serves as a centralized collection of architecture diagrams created and maintained using [Draw.io](https://drawio.com/) These diagrams provide visual representations of systems, processes, and designs relevant to Neptune Software projects and initiatives. They aim to enhance collaboration, communication, and understanding across teams by offering clear and detailed insights into the technical and functional aspects of our architecture.

**Key Features**
- Clarity in Design: Well-structured diagrams for easy understanding of complex systems.
- Collaboration-Ready: Optimized for teamwork, with support for updates and feedback.
- Reusable Components: Standardized elements for consistency across multiple projects.
- Version Control: Track changes and revisions seamlessly with Git.

Whether you're a developer, architect, or stakeholder, these diagrams are your go-to resource for understanding the big picture and the finer details of Neptune's system architecture.
